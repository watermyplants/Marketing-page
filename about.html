        <h3>Forget to water your plants like most of us? Water My Plants will help you solve this problem by creating
          a fun habit. Available on iPhone and iPad.</h3>
        <p>Water My Plants is the household wingman. We made Water My Plants as a personal challenge to learn how to
          develop iOS apps and solve one constant problem at home…</p>
        <p>Personalize your plants – Plants deserve to have unique water schedules, plant selfies, and fun videos.
          Plants are our green babies!</p>
        <p>We were forgetting to water plants because it’s boring to us. (We have mad love and respect for people that
          find zen and pleasure in taking care of their plants) We just sucked at watering. And so we decided to focus
          on bringing fun and creativity into the watering routine. And in doing so, watering has become a fun and
          fulfilling thing to do.</p>
        <p>Creating good habits!</p>
        <p>We decided to make a water plant reminder app. It sounded simple, and to us, it even sounded pretty boring.
          But that’s when we had our “ah ha” moment.</p>
